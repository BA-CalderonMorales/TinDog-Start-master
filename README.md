<p>A few notes from Udemy lectures</p>
<strong>DRY: Do Not Repeat Yourself</strong>
<h2>Code Refactoring</h2>
  1. Readability: How well can your code be read.
  2. Modularity: Is it scalable?
  3. Efficiency: How difficult is it to run your code on the server?
  4. Length: Making sure you adhere to DRY. Don't sacrifice readability for length/fun.
