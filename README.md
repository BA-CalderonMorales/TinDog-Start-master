<h2>TinDog Starting Files</h2>
<p>Webpage was created with the assistance of the Udemy:</p>
<p>https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/.</p>
<p>It was meant to assist me in better styling basic html5 and css files so that they are easier to read and easier to </p>
<p>manipulate in the way that I want to with bootstrap 5.<p>
<p>You can see how this website looks by looking at the GitHub link to this project site as soon as I finish with the </p>
